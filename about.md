This is Ð° GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Arthropod Systematics & Phylogeny](https://arthropod-systematics.arphahub.com/).

The scope of the journal covers integrative taxonomy, morphology/anatomy, phylogeny (molecular or morphology-based), bio- and phylogeography, and palaeontology. Purely descriptive work, faunistic work, and (usually) work with a strong regional focus are outside the scope. Descriptions of new taxa are welcome, but must be embedded in a novel wider context (e.g. a phylogenetic, evolutionary, or biogeographical framework).
